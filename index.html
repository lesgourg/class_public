The purpose of CLASS is to simulate the evolution of linear perturbations in the universe and to compute CMB and large scale structure observables. Its name also comes from the fact that it is written in object-oriented style mimicking the notion of class. Classes are a wonderfull programming feature available e.g. in C++ and python, but these languages are known to be less vectorizable/parallelizable than plain C (or Fortran), and hence potentially slower. For CLASS we choose to use plain C for high performances, while organizing the code in a few modules that reproduce the architecture and philosophy of C++ classes, for optimal readability and modularity.
<p>
<h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>
<p>
The use of CLASS is free provided that when you use it in a publication, you cite at least the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2933">CLASS II: Approximation schemes</a> (reference below). You are welcome to cite any other CLASS paper if relevant!
<p>
  There are three ways to get to use CLASS. If you only want to use it through its python wrapper <tt>classy</tt> and not modify it, just install it as a python module with <tt>pip install classy</tt>. If you want to see the code and/or modify it just for yourself, download a tar.gz archive of the latest released (master branch) version, v3.3.1, by clicking <a href="class_public-3.3.1.tar.gz" download="class_public-3.3.1.tar.gz">class_public-3.3.1.tar.gz</a>. But if you are familiar with <tt>git</tt> repositories, and you wish to develop a new branch of the code, or see all public branches and/or old versions, you will prefer to clone it from the <a href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public" target="_blank">class_public</a> git repository.
<br>
<hr color=#d2b48c>
<h2><a name="documentation">Documentation</a></h2>

After downloading the code, unpack the archive (<tt>tar -zxvf
class_public-vx.y.z.tar.gz</tt>), go to the class directory (<tt>cd
  class_public-vx.y.z/</tt>) and compile. Several details on the CLASS compilation are given on the <a
href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/wiki/Installation"
target="_blank"> installation wiki page</a>. In a nutshell:

<p>

<li> If you are only interested in running CLASS through its python wrapper <tt>classy</tt>,
install it with <tt>pip install .</tt> (since v3.3.0; before you had to execute <tt>make clean; make -j all</tt>).
To check that things work, you may run any of our demo python scripts located in <tt>scripts/</tt> (e.g. <tt>python scripts/warmup.py</tt>), or any of the equivalent jupyter notebooks located in <tt>notebooks/</tt>.

<p>

<li> If instead you are interested in compiling the C code and running in a terminal, execute <tt>make clean; make -j class</tt>.
To check that the code runs, type: <tt>./class explanatory.ini</tt>
The <tt>explanatory.ini</tt> file is a reference input file,
containing and explaning the use of all possible input parameters. We
recommend to read it, to keep it unchanged (for future reference), and
to create for your own purposes some shorter input files, containing
only the input lines which are useful for you. Input files must have a
<tt>*.ini</tt> extension.
If you want to play with the precision/speed of the code, you can use
one of the provided precision files (e.g. <tt>cl_permille.pre</tt>) or
modify one of them, and run with two input files (e.g. <tt>./class
test.ini cl_permille.pre</tt>).

<p>

For more details, view
our <a href="class_public-3.3.0/doc/manual/html/index.html">online
html documentation</a> generated by doxygen (credits D.C.
Hooper). Other CLASS papers dedicated to various aspects of the code
are listed <a href="class.html#papers">below</a>. You can also look
at <a href="https://lesgourg.github.io/courses.html"
target="_blank"> slides from CLASS-dedicated courses</a>.

<p>

To use CLASS from python, or ipython notebooks, or from the Monte
Python parameter extraction code, you need to compile not only the
code, but also its python wrapper. This can be done by typing just
<tt>make</tt> instead of <tt>make class</tt>. More details on the
wrapper and its compilation are found on the <a
href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/wiki" target="_blank">wiki
page</a>.

<p>

Since version 2.3, the package includes an improved plotting script
called <tt>CPU.py</tt> (Class Plotting Utility), written by Benjamin
Audren and Jesus Torrado. It can plot the Cl&apos;s, the P(k) or any other
CLASS puput, for one or several models, as well as their ratio or
percentage difference. The syntax and list of available options is
obtained by typing <tt>pyhton CPU.py --help</tt>. There is a similar
script for MATLAB, written by Thomas Tram. To use it, once in MATLAB,
type <tt>help plot_CLASS_output.m</tt>

<p>

If you want to develop the code, we
suggest that you download it from the <a
href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public" target="_blank"> github
webpage</a> rather than from class-code.net. Then you will enjoy all
the feature of git repositories. You can even develop your own branch
and get it merged to the public distribution, following the <a
href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/wiki/Public-Contributing"

        <ul>
          <li> Default version of HMcode now set to HMcode 2020. See the related input parameters in <tt>explanatory.ini</tt>, section on non-linear parameters, point 1.b).
          <li> The <tt>fourier.c</tt> module has been restructured. Halofit and HMcode are now external modules located in the <tt>external/</tt> directory.
          <li> New input flags <tt>'numerical_nowiggle'</tt> and <tt>'analytic_nowiggle'</tt>. See <tt>explanatory.ini</tt>, section on non-linear parameters, point 2). The flags enforce the calculation of the linear no-wiggle power spectrum, computed either numerically (by filtering the linear power spectrum with a smoothing algorithm) or analytically (with the no-wiggle fitting function of Eisenstein and Hu). In terminal runs, they get written in output files. In python runs, they can be retrieved with the <tt>classy</tt> functions <tt>.pk_numerical_nw()</tt> and <tt>.pk_analytical_nw()</tt>.
          <li> Modernized compilation file <tt>setup.py</tt>, compatible with <tt>pipy</tt>. You may install the python wrapper by just typing <tt>pip install .</tt> in the CLASS directory. The old <tt>make -j class</tt> still works for compiling the C code. Note that <tt>make -j</tt> still installs the python wrapper, but we recommend switching to <tt>pip install .</tt> in the long term.
          <li> Added two accurate BBN interpolation tables to infer the primordial helium fraction: <tt>external/bbn/sBBN.dat</tt> (from <a href='https://parthenope.na.infn.it'>Parthenope v3.0.0</a>) and <tt>external/bbn/sBBN_primat.dat</tt> (from <a href='http://www2.iap.fr/users/pitrou/primat.htm'>PRIMAT</a> version of the 20/09/2024). The former is used as default. Other choices can be adjusted by setting <tt>'YHe'</tt> to <tt>'BBN'</tt> and passing the relevant file name through the precision parameter <tt>'sBBN_file'</tt>.
          <li> Solved a parallelisation issue: the code was becoming very slow for non-flat models when running on many cores (hundred or more).
          <li> Correction of a small mistake in the spline integration formula in <tt>tools/arrays.c</tt>, leading to tiny inaccuracies - especially in sigma(R) and P_NL(k), and to a lesser extent in thermodynamics calculations (credits: C. Radermacher)
          <li> Correction in the tight-coupling approximation for tensor perturbations, to avoid 0.25% error on tensor Cls (credits: C. Pitrou)
          <li> New flag <tt>'get_perturbations_in_current_gauge'</tt>, to avoid a systematic conversion of perturbations to the Newtonian gauge when setting <tt>'k_output_values'</tt> and using <tt>.get_perturbations()</tt> (see <tt>explanatory.ini</tt>, section on general parameters, point 4.d)
          <li> 25.06.2025 (<tt>v3.3.1</tt>): fixed bug introduced in v3.0, leading to random (but very rare) segmentation fault when running with <tt>'tau_reio'</tt> as input parameter (thanks to Martin White for pointing out); corrected the initial conditions for the IDM-g temperature (thanks to Maria Archidiacono for pointing out); fixed bug in classy function <tt>scale_dependent_growth_factor_f_cb()</tt>, and added classy functions <tt>scale_dependent_growth_factor_D()</tt> and <tt>scale_dependent_growth_factor_D_cb()</tt>; added the python build requirements in a <tt>pyproject.toml</tt> file (thanks to Sefa Pamuk for pointing out)

          <li> Implementation of multi-interacting dark matter (<tt>idm</tt>) as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04074" target="_blank">2010.04074</a>. The <tt>idm</tt> species may interact not only with dark radiation following the ETHOS formalism (a feature already introduced in v2.9), but also with photons and baryons, with the possibility to have 1, 2 or 3 interaction channels at the same time. For a description of new functionalities, search for <tt>idm</tt> in <tt>explanatory.ini</tt> (credits: N. Becker, D. C. Hooper, N. Sch&ouml;neberg)
          <li> This release also features minor typo and bug fixes, as well as a systematic correction of the indentation of the C files (credits: D. C. Hooper)
          <li> 10.10.2023 (<tt>v3.2.1</tt>): in the python wrapper classy, new function <tt>scale_dependent_growth_factor()</tt>, and fixes in <tt>get_pk_all()</tt>; in input, new parameter names <tt>ln10^10A_s, 100*theta_s, 100*theta_star, S8</tt>; increased default precision of background module; fixed compatibility issue with cython 3; minor bug fixes (credits: J. Ange, B. Bolliet, S. Guenther, L. Honorez-Lopez, M. Lucca, F. McCarty, C. Pitrou, J. Torrado - and as usual JL, NS, TT)
          <li> 3.02.2024 (<tt>v3.2.2</tt>): the calculation of the CMB lensing potential power spectrum has been made considerably more accurate and efficient at large l (and has also been improved at low l in the non-Limber range). One can now obtain very accurate lensed CMB Cl's at very large l values (e.g. 6000 or more) without any slow-down of the code. The Limber approximation is still used below <tt>l_switch_limber</tt>, set by default to 10. The new calculation, called <tt>full_limber</tt> inside the code, is toggled by an input flag <tt>want_lcmb_full_limber</tt> set by default to <tt>yes</tt>. Users interested in the details of this feature can read the comments in <tt>input/precision.h</tt> regarding the new precision parameters <tt>perturbations_sampling_boost_above_age_fraction</tt>, <tt>q_logstep_limber</tt>, <tt>k_max_limber_over_l_max_scalars</tt>, and the modified precision parameter <tt>k_max_tau0_over_l_max</tt>. Thanks to B. Bolliet for his precious help on these features. Also, in <tt>classy</tt>, enhanced interpolation features in <tt>get_pk_all()</tt>: the log of P(k) can be interpolated with either a linear or cubic (default) algorithm.
          <li> 20.02.2024 (<tt>v3.2.3</tt>): improvement in compilation method. CLASS is now pip installable with <tt>pip install classy</tt>. For the C code compilation, OpenMP is no longer required. Even if the code is still written in plain C, the few modules using parallelisation will now get compiled with the C++ compiler found on your machine (for instance, GNU g++ or clang), which has some in-built parallelisation syntax. To allow for this, some macros have been adapted, and the few lines with OpenMP parallelisation syntax have been changed to match C++ parallelisation syntax.
          <li> 30.09.2024 (<tt>v3.2.4</tt>): new classy function <tt>set_baseline</tt> to set up quickly some baseline parameters: e.g. <tt>.set_baseline('planck18_lens_bao')</tt>. Added <tt>Neff</tt> (not <tt>N_eff</tt>) as a new input parameter with shooting, representing the request for a given total effective neutrino number (rather than just an effective number of ultra-relativistic relics <tt>N_ur</tt>). Fixed numpy compilation issue and minor bugs.
          <li> 4.10.2024 (<tt>v3.2.5</tt>): made RealSpaceInterface work again, see <tt>external/RealSpaceInterface/README</tt> for instructions (credits Timothy Morton and Mowen Zhao). Fixed bug introduced in 3.2.4 affecting shooting convergence.

          <li> Implementation of varying fundamental constants alpha (fine structure constant) and me (effective electron mass). This feature already existed in HyRec2020; we implemented it also in RecFastCLASS and in the CLASS wrapper of the two recombination codes (credits N. Sch&ouml;neberg). The physics is described e.g. in Hart and Chluba <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03925" target="_blank">1705.03925</a>. For a description of input parameters and functionalities, search <tt>varying_fundamental_constants</tt> in <tt>explanatory.ini</tt>.
          <li> Minor updates in Hyrec2020 (credits N. Lee) and several minor bug fixes.
          <li> 7.12.2021 (<tt>v3.1.1</tt>): instead of <tt>Omega_cdm</tt> or <tt>omega_cdm</tt>, user can pass in input <tt>Omega_m</tt> or <tt>omega_m</tt>: the code will adjust automatically the CDM abundance, taking into account all other non-relativistic abundances; also, added new functions <tt>perturbations_at_z()</tt> and <tt>perturbations_at_k_and_z()</tt>, and fixed several minor typos and bugs (credits: N. Sch&ouml;neberg, Fereshteh Majidi)
          <li> 22.02.2022 (<tt>v3.1.2</tt>): in the python wrapper classy, several new functions: <tt>Om_b(z), Om_cdm(z), Om_ncdm(z), angular_distance_from_to(), scale_independent_f_sigma8(), effective_f_sigma8(), effective_f_sigma8_spline(), get_transfer_and_k_and_z(), get_Weyl_pk_and_k_and_z()</tt>; behavior of <tt>sigma()</tt> and <tt>get_pk_and_k_and_z()</tt> improved; fixed a bug concerning the maximum value k_max used for P(k) calculations and output.
          <li> 24.03.2022 (<tt>v3.1.3</tt>): made the shooting method much more efficient for <tt>sigma8</tt>; fixed a bug affecting Decaying Dark Matter results since v2.10.1, detected by Jozef Bucko; fixed a memory leak in <tt>get_transfer_and_k_and_z()</tt> (credits: N. Sch&ouml;neberg)

          <li> Several major improvements detailed below in the description of v2.10. Most important: new module calculating CMB spectral distortions, and implementation of various models for energy injection relevant for both anisotropies and distortions (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04619" target="_blank">1910.04619</a>); recombination calculated by default with HyRec2020 (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14114" target="_blank">2007.14114</a>) or optionally with an improved RecFastCLASS; background and thermodynamics equations integrated with the same ODE solvers as perturbation equations, by default the implicit <tt>ndf15</tt> solver; improved structure and style of <tt>input</tt>, <tt>background</tt> and <tt>thermodynamics</tt> modules (credits D.C. Hooper, N. Lee, D. Meinert, and particularly N. Schoeneberg, M. Lucca)
          <li> Two modules renamed in order to better reflect their physical role: <tt>nonlinear</tt> renamed as <tt>fourier</tt> (calculation of observables in Fourier space: P(k,z), delta_i(k,z), etc.), and <tt>spectra</tt> renamed as <tt>harmonic</tt> (calculation of observables in harmonic space: C_l&apos;s). Also, for each module, the name of the main structure and the prefix now matches exactly the module name. The renaming task is done automatically by a script <tt>CLASS_rename.py</tt> distributed with the code, that may transform any CLASS version forward and backward.
          <li> These are the biggest changes ever in a release, and we care about our users who wish to propagate these changes smoothly through their own modified version! Thus we provide many incremental revisions of the <tt>master</tt> branch, tagged as 2.10.0 to 2.10.8 (see below). Once your branch is up-to-date (merged) with 2.9.4, merge it step-by-step with 2.10.0, then 2.10.1, then 2.10.2, etc., up to 2.10.8. Each step will update only one of the new modules, plus its ancillary files for consistency. In this way, potential conflicts should remain tractable. Importantly, <em>after each step</em>, you should check whether your code still compilables (and possibly fix issues until it does). Once you have merged with 2.10.8 and your code compiles and runs, type <tt>python CLASS_rename.py --method rename</tt>, and you will be up-to-date with 3.0.0!
          <li> 19.03.2021 (<tt>v3.0.1</tt>): Updates to match online version of HyRec-2 (effective rate table was extended for the case Tm>Tr, update for varying constants).
          <li> 8.09.2021 (<tt>v3.0.2</tt>): Minor fixes: issues of indentation, memory leaks (in HyRec-2, shooting, ncdm), bugs when having only tensors, three names changed erroneously by the automatic renaming script (<tt>nonlinear_method, nonlinear_scale, nonlinear_min_k_max</tt>). Restored input parameters <tt>DM_annihilation_fraction</tt> and function <tt>distortions_read_detector_noisefile()</tt>. Increased default value of precision parameter <tt>nonlinear_min_k_max</tt>, and improved the scripts for the continuous integration workflow.

        <ul>
          <li> This version, whose tags are available on the <a href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public" target="_blank">class_public</a> git repository, are only meant to introduce the changes from 2.9.4 to 3.0.0 in a smooth, step-by-step way. By merging your branch successively with each of the tagged versions 2.10.0 to 2.10.8, you will keep potential conflicts under control. The description of each tagged version is useful to understand the main differences between v2.9.4 and v3.0.0.
          <li> v2.10.0: Technical preparation for the next steps. Small update of several files and algorithms in the <tt>tools/</tt> directory (including new functionalities for splining, interpolating, parsing). Also, the files relevant for BBN calculations, for the <tt>external_Pk</tt> option and for the <tt>RealSpaceInterface</tt> are moved to a new directory <tt>external/</tt>
          <li> v2.10.1: Input module entirely re-organised, with distinct functions parsing different categories of input parameters. New comprehensive input file <tt>explanatory.ini</tt> reflecting the new structure. Default cosmological parameter values set to a LambdaCDM model with massless neutrinos that is the closest possible to the Planck 2018 best-fit with m_nu=0.06eV (the new CLASS default model has the same peak scale).
          <li> v2.10.2: Restructured background module. The differential equations are integrated over log(a) instead of conformal time. They are handled exactly in the same way (with the same generic functions, the same syntax, the same ODE solvers) as the perturbation equations. By default they get integrated with the implicit solver <tt>ndf15</tt>. This allows to implement extended cosmologies with stiff background equations, like e.g. in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08486" target="_blank">2008.08486</a>.
          <li> v2.10.3: Fully rewritten and restructured thermodynamics module. Recombination is handled by default by HyRec-2 (by N. Lee and Y. Ali-Haimoud, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14114" target="_blank">2007.14114</a>), or optionally by RecfastCLASS (an improved version of RecFast 1.5 with slightly better approximations at early times and no discontinuities). These two codes are located in the <tt>external</tt> directory and called through dedicated wrappers. The new thermodynmics module can handle many more scenarios for heating / energy injection, implemented in an external module <tt>external/heating</tt> called by the thermodynamics module if necessary. For details on new input parameters, see <tt>explanatory.ini</tt>, and for more information on the underlying physics, see the release paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04619" target="_blank">1910.04619</a>. Either HyRec or Recfast are used to provide differential equations for the ionisation rates only, and in all cases, the system of equations for ionisation and temperature is integrated by CLASS, exactly in the same way (with the same generic functions, the same syntax, the same ODE solvers) as the perturbation equations. By default equations get integrated with the implicit solver <tt>ndf15</tt>. This allows to implement extended cosmologies with stiffer thermodynamical equation, like e.g. in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04074" target="_blank">2010.04074</a>. Finally, default value of N_eff (= <tt>N_ur</tt> in absence of massive neutrinos and extra light relics) changed from 3.046 to 3.0440 (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01074" target="_blank">2008.01074</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02726" target="_blank">2012.02726</a>). Changes propagated to all input files and to a new non-exhaustive input file <tt>default.ini</tt> that is more user-friendly than the exhaustive <tt>explanatory.ini</tt>.
          <li> v2.10.4: Very minor updates to the perturbation module (just to propagate the changes in the background and thermodynamics ones).
          <li> v2.10.5: Very minor updates to the primordial, nonlinear, transfer, spectra and lensing modules, to propagate the changes in the background and thermodynamics ones. Also, new option to fix a larger k_max in the primordial module than in the perturbation module (optional input parameter <tt>primordial_P_k_max_1/Mpc</tt> or <tt>primordial_P_k_max_h/Mpc</tt>).
          <li> v2.10.6: Entirely new distortion module <tt>distortions.c</tt>, called after the lensing module if necessary. It computes CMB spectral distortions induced both by exotic energy injection mechanisms (called just <tt>injection</tt> with CLASS) or by heating mechanisms inherent to the standard thermal history (called <tt>noninjection</tt>). Uses the Green function method of J. Chluba (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6120v2" target="_blank">1304.6120</a>), like in <a href="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~jchluba/Science/CosmoTherm/Welcome.html" target="_blank">CosmoTherm</a>, and its PCA decomposition (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5751" target="_blank">1306.5751</a>). The same tabulated Green function are located in <tt>external/distortions</tt> and distributed within the CLASS package with kind permission of J. Chluba. The heating mechanisms responsible for distortions are implemented in the external <tt>injection</tt> and <tt>noninjection</tt> modules located in <tt>external/heating</tt>. For details on all possible input parameters and output, see <tt>explanatory.ini</tt> and the <tt>README</tt> file in the folder <tt>external/distortions</tt>.
          <li> v2.10.7: Updated version of all our examples of python scripts (in <tt>scripts/</tt>) and jupyter notebooks (in <tt>notebooks/</tt>) for compatibility with the new version and with python 3.
          <li> v2.10.8: Updated doxygen documentation (in <tt>doc/</tt>), C++ wrapper (in <tt>cpp/</tt>) and test codes (in <tt>test/</tt>). Added the script <tt>CLASS_rename.py</tt> that renames a few modules / structures / prefixes and transform automatically 2.10.8 into 3.0.0 (see <tt>python CLASS_rename.py --help</tt>).

          <li> two additional species: dark matter interacting with dark radiation <tt>idm_dr</tt>, and its partner: interacting dark radiation <tt>idr</tt>. Follows the  ETHOS framework described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05344" target="_blank">1512.05344</a>. As a special case, can also take as input the parameters of the models of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04351" target="_blank">1507.04351</a> (with non-abelian dark matter, dark gluons...). See explanatory.ini for the parametrisation of both cases and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06870" target="_blank">1706.06870</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01496" target="_blank">1907.01496</a> for more details. The new sector includes a tight-coupling approximation and a radiation streaming approximation that are useful for studying dark decoupling, dark acoustic oscillations, etc., without slowing down the code (credits M. Archidiacono, S. Bohr, D.C. Hooper)
          <li> new function <tt>nonlinear_pk_tilt_at_k_and_z()</tt> giving the effective logarithmic slope of the matter power spectrum at any given wavenumber and redhsift; useful in data likelihoods related to large scale structure (credits M. Archidiacono)
          <li> 3.03.2020 (<tt>v2.9.1</tt>): restored better way to interpolate P(k,z) along k like before v2.8; fixed memory leak in <tt>idm_dr</tt> sector (credits D.C. Hooper)
          <li> 25.03.2020 (<tt>v2.9.2</tt>): various bug fixes related to the N-body gauge and <tt>idm_dr</tt> features, to the <tt>p_cb</tt> output, and to the <tt>fld</tt> initial conditions in Newtonian gauge (credits E. Bellini, M. Buen-Abad, A. Hall, S. Heimersheim)

          <li> 20.07.2020 (<tt>v2.9.4</tt>): increased default precision of 1D shooting; fixed small details in <tt>Halofit</tt>; improved coding style of <tt>pk_eq</tt> method; removed old test codes; plus minor bug fixes (credits J.L. Bernal, F. Lepori, I. Tutusaus)

          <li> accurate implementation of HMcode (A. Mead et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02154" target="_blank">1602.02154</a>) on top of Halofit. Switch on with non <tt>linear = HMcode</tt>. The default settings are calibrated against DM-only COSMIC EMU simulations (Heitmann et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7849" target="_blank">1304.7849</a>). The baryonic feedback can be switched on and customized with the entry <tt>feedback model</tt> described in <tt>explanatory.ini</tt> (credits S. Brieden, M. Archidiacono)
          <li> new entry <tt>Nbody gauge transfer functions</tt> to optionally output the transfer functions of the density and velocity of each species, as well as selected metric perturbations in N-body gauge. Useful for a GR intepretation of N-body simulations, see e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04756" target="_blank">1505.04756</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04236" target="_blank">1610.04236</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00904" target="_blank">1811.00904</a>.
          <li> the code previously defined the time of recombination from the peak of the visibility function. There is another sensible definition: when the Thomson optical depth crosses one. The code now computes everything (redshift, angular distance, sound horizon...) at both times, with a suffix <tt>_rec</tt> for the first definition and <tt>_star</tt> for the second.
          <li> better performance when computing number count Cls, thanks to the re-ordering of some operations (credits S. Schoeneberg, M. Archidiacono). Note that we do not include yet the FFTlog method (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09540" target="_blank">1807.09540</a>) in the master branch, but you can already find it and use it in the separate branch <tt>class_matter</tt> of the public class GitHub repository.
          <li> if <tt>background_verbose</tt> is set to 2 or more, the code writes a new section in the standard output, with more details on all the omega's and Omega's for the model being computed (credits N. Schoeneberg)
          <li> unlike recently claimed by some authors, we re-checked that the baryon sound speed is consistently included in the code. Some PDF notes on this topic will soon be added here.
          <li> something relevant for developers but not for end-users: there was a major internal restructuring of the <tt>nonlinear.c</tt> and <tt>spectra.c</tt> modules, to avoid redundency, be more consistent and improve efficiency. Some functions are deprecated (but not suppressed), and some warnings alert the user when they should switch to newer and better functions. These <a href="text_v28.pdf" target="_blank">technical notes</a> explain the changes, their motivations, and how to get around with them when you merge you own branch forked from <=2.7 with >=2.8.
         <li> better visibility of precision parameters: their definitions, default values and descriptions are now all grouped in a unique file <tt>include/precisions.h</tt> that contains nothing else (credits N. Schoeneberg)
         <li> fixed several minor bugs (credits M. Archidiacono, S. Brieden, N. Schoeneberg, J. Torrado)
         <li> 25.11.2019 (<tt>v2.8.1</tt>): further bug fixes: avoiding random rounding errors, restoring calculation of non-linear corrections for Cls only (thanks to Antony Lewis)
         <li> 3.12.2019 (<tt>v2.8.2</tt>): better handling of classy version number, avoid memory leaks for extreme parameter values (useful especially for nested sampling) (credits Jesus Torrado)

          <li> when running with <tt>ncdm</tt> (non cold dark matter) while asking for the matter power spectrum <tt>mPk</tt>, you will automatically get both the total non-relativistic matter spectrum <em>Pm(k,z)</em> and the baryons-plus-cdm-only (<tt>cb</tt>) spectrum <em>Pcb(k,z)</em>. The latter is useful e.g. for computing the power spectrum of galaxies, which traces <tt>bc</tt> instead of total matter (see e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0866" target="_blank">1311.0866</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04672" target="_blank">1807.04672</a>).

          <li>  implementation of the <em>P(k) equal</em> method (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.019" target="_blank">0810.0190</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07230" target="_blank">1601.07230</a>) when using Halofit in combination with a fluid with arbitrary (<tt>w0_fld</tt>, <tt>wa_fld</tt>) parameters. Switch on with entry <tt>pk_eq=yes</tt> (the default is <tt>no</tt>). The method is applied up to a redshift <tt>pk_eq_z_max</tt> set by default to 5 (Credits: M. Archidiacono, S. Clesse)

          <li> few bug and memory leak fixes
          <li> 22.10.2018 (<tt>v2.7.1</tt>): removed useless <tt>.ini</tt> and <tt>.pre</tt> files; added input files matching Planck baseline model with best fit values (<tt>base_2015_plikHM_TT_lowTEB_lensing.ini</tt>, <tt>base_2018_plikHM_TTTEEE_lowl_lowE_lensing.ini</tt>); in python wrapper, reinitialisation with <tt>struct_cleanup()</tt> now done automatically; several minor bug fixes (credits D.C.

           <li> 11.04.2019 (<tt>v2.7.2</tt>): added couple of functions in wrapper (credits J. Torrado, N. Sch&ouml;neberg) for compatibility with LSS likelihoods in <a href="https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Cobaya v1.1</a>

          <li> by default, the perturbations of the fluid sector <tt>_fld</tt> (usually employed to play the role of Dark Energy) now follow the PPF approximation instead of real fluid equations, which allows to cross the phantom divide (but user can still switch to true fluid equations, see <tt>use_ppf</tt> parameter in <tt>explanatory.ini</tt>). Our PPF equations afe implemented in both newtonian and synchronous gauge as explained in these <a href="PPF_formalism.pdf" target="_blank">notes</a>. Also, it is now simpler to customise the function w_fld(a) because it appears in only one place in the function <tt>background_w_fld()</tt>.
          <li> compilation and installation scripts made more robust, <tt>classy</tt> wrapper compatible with python 3 if you compile with the option <tt>PYTHON=python3 make all</tt> (credits M. Millea); you can use it in your python sessions, scripts, notebooks, etc.; note however that MontePython is still only compatible with python 2.7 for the moment, and wants a <tt>classy</tt> version compiled with python 2.x.
          <li> more accurate calculation of the scale independent CDM growth factor D(a) - and f(a) - taking into account radiation and dark energy.
          <li> option <tt>extra metric transfer functions</tt> to output the transfer functions of all metric perturbations (credits W. Valkenburg).
          <li> among the reionisation parametrisation options <tt>reio_parametrisation</tt>, added a new scheme <tt>reio_inter</tt> for linear interpolation between discrete values of xe(z). Other schemes (e.g. tanh() steps) are still there.
          <li> 2.07.2017 (<tt>v2.6.1</tt>): few bug fixes (e.g. for P_NL(k) with isocurvature modes); solved memory leak issues in the wrapper.
          <li> 23.10.2017 (<tt>v2.6.2</tt>): minor improvements; the most important is a boost of the Halofit precision: previously, purely numerical random errors in Halofit could spoil your future LSS experiment forecasts; also updated the BBN interpolation table (credits: Ophelia Pisanti), added <tt>sigma8</tt> as a possible input parameter instead of <tt>A_s</tt>, and gave the user the possibility to control manually the quadrature scheme used to discretise the momentum space of NCDM (only relevant for NCDM experts willing to achieve high precision, e.g., with WDM at large k); also, improved compilation script, gave possibility to run with tensors only (e.g. <tt>modes=t, A_s=1, r=1</tt> would mean: tensors only with <tt>A_t=1</tt>), and improved formula for the diffusion damping scale.
          <li> 24.10.2017 (<tt>v2.6.3</tt>): restored compatibility with python 3 (broken in 2.6.2 by small modification of setup.py)
